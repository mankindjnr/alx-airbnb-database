2. Design Database Schema (DDL)
***

Objective: Write SQL queries to define the database schema (create tables, set constraints).

Instructions:

Based on the provided database specification, create SQL CREATE TABLE statements for each entity.

Ensure proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Create necessary indexes on columns for optimal performance.

## WHAT IS SQL DDL AND SQL DML?

SQL (Structured Query Language) has two primary categories for managing and manipulating data in a database:

DDL (Data Definition Language): This involves defining and managing the structure of the database. Commands in DDL include:

CREATE: To create a new database, table, or other database objects.

ALTER: To modify an existing database object, like a table.

DROP: To delete a database or database object.

TRUNCATE: To remove all records from a table, but keep the table structure.

RENAME: To change the name of an existing database object.

DML (Data Manipulation Language): This is used for managing data within the database objects created by DDL. Commands in DML include:

SELECT: To retrieve data from the database.

INSERT: To add new records to a table.

UPDATE: To modify existing records in a table.

DELETE: To remove records from a table.

In essence, DDL commands define the schema and structure of your database, while DML commands manipulate the data within those structures. If you have any specific questions or need examples, feel free to ask!
